# (N)Vim plugin for the jsix interface definition language

This is a small syntax plugin I wrote to help make the interface definition
files for [jsix][] more readable.

[jsix]: https://github.com/justinian/jsix

Install as usual with your preferred (n)vim package manager.

Vim-plug:

    Plug 'jsix-os/j6def.vim'

Packer:

    use 'jsix-os/j6def.vim'

etc.
